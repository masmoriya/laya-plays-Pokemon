"""The v0.1 route: one waypoint per map, axis-first stepping, a local sidestep.

Not a pathfinder. v0.1 walks six maps whose connections are static and public, so the
route is a hand-written list of tiles, most of them `warp_event` coordinates straight out
of `data/maps/objects/*.asm`. Anything past Viridian needs a real occupancy map with warp
edges, which is the v0.2 item in CONTEXT section 2.

`ponytail:` the indoor tiles are exact (they are warp coordinates in the source). The two
outdoor legs, Pallet Town's north exit and the walk up Route 1, are a straight line up the
middle of a map whose width is known from `map_constants.asm` but whose walkable column is
not. Confirm both with `jpp probe` on a real ROM; the ceiling is the learned map.
