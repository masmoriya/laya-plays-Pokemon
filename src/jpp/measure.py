A decision is one Jev call. Wall clock runs from a run's first call to its last and is
summed across runs, so idle emulation between branches counts against us. The calibration
target is `faints_this_turn`, labelled from the RAM on the next decision of the same
battle, and it is always printed next to the base rate and the constant predictor. If ours
is not lower, this says so.
