Two rules do the work here. Jev picks from a deck the code already proved legal, so it
cannot name a button or an option that does not exist. And each branch kind builds its own
state: sending the whole world is CONTEXT section 4's first jaggedness risk, and a padded
state measurably moves the answer.
